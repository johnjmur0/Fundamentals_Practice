# fundamentals-practice

This was an old repo I was using to get some public C# code, doing LeetCode or Project Euler problems. 

Plus some exercises from this book, which I liked. 
[A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Wengrow](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/ref=asc_df_1680507222/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459709175715&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15407491119665699660&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1018405&hvtargid=pla-917825050002&psc=1)

Planning to get back to this soon actually - to finish up some last chapters in that book, and to use C# for a project that will feed into my master planning dashboard project, Now that I've finished v1 of that plus the Mint R repo.
